This is the third coordinated Science WG release train. This year the
new project releases include:

numerical data in Java. Eclipse January is inspired by the Python
library, NumPy. This release deprecates many methods that use the
constants in the Dataset interfaces and adds replacements that use its
sub-classes. This is part of the migration to those sub-classes to
sub-interfaces with the concrete classes moved to an internal
package. This will allow for alternate implementations of these
interfaces.

for statistical computing and graphics. StatET offers a set of mature
tools for R coding and package building including a fully integrated R
console, R script editors, an integrated R graphics view and other
features. This release is a maintenance release of StatET 4.0
providing bug fixes and minor enhancements.

scientific workflows. The goal of Triquetrum is to support a wide
range of use cases, ranging from automated processes based on
predefined models, to replaying ad-hoc research workflows recorded
from a user's actions in a scientific workbench UI. This release
updates the Ptolemy II runtime, supports Eclipse 2019-09 and JDK 13.

heterogeneous quantum-classical computing architectures. XACC provides
the software interfaces and infrastructure required by domain
computational scientists to offload computationally intractable work
to an attached quantum accelerator. This initial 1.0.0 release
provides the first iteration of the core XACC API which decomposes the
quantum-classical programming workflow into frontend, middle-end, and
backend architectural layers.
