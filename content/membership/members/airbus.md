Airbus is a leading commercial aircraft manufacturer.

Airbus' modern and comprehensive product line comprises highly successful families of aircraft ranging from 100 to more than 500 seats: the single-aisle A320 Family, including the A320neo, the widebody, long-range A330/A340, all-new next generation A350 XWB Family and the double-deck A380 Family. The company also continues to broaden its scope and product range by applying its expertise to the military market. It is as well extending its portfolio of freighter aircraft that will set new standards in the general and express freight market sectors.

Across all its fly-by-wire aircraft families Airbus' unique approach ensures that aircraft share the highest possible degree of commonality in airframes, on-board systems, cockpits and handling characteristics, which reduces significantly operating costs for airlines.

Dedicated to helping airlines enhance the profitability of their fleets, Airbus also delivers a wide range of customer services in all areas of support, tailored to the needs of individual operators all over the world.

Headquartered in Toulouse, Airbus is owned by the Airbus Group, a global leader in aerospace, defence and related services. In addition to Airbus' commercial aircraft activities, this group is comprised of the Airbus Helicopters and Airbus Defence and Space business units and maintains a presence on every continent.

Airbus itself is a truly global enterprise with fully-owned subsidiaries in the United States China, Japan and in the Middle East, spare parts centres in Hamburg, Frankfurt, Washington, Beijing and Singapore, training centres in Toulouse, Miami, Hamburg and Beijing and more than 150 field service offices around the world.

Airbus also relies on industrial co-operation and partnerships with major companies all over the world, and a network of some 1,500 suppliers in 30 countries. Airbus today consistently captures about half of all commercial airliner orders.
