iSencia Belgium specializes in solutions for automated and interactive decision processes.
Our Passerelle EDM platform is applied in different application domains, ranging from traditional business process management to support for (semi-)automated scientific experiments and analysis workflows.
 
The open-source Passerelle workflow engine is also used independently of the complete Passerelle EDM platform, e.g. for data acquisition and control in synchrotron beamlines and similar facilities.
At Diamond LS it is integrated in their DAWN RCP scientific workbench for data analysis workflows.
 
iSencia has offices in Belgium (Ghent), Spain (Barcelona) and Sweden.
